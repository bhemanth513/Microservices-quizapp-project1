Agile Scrum
=============
widely used project management tool that promotes collaboration, flexibility and Iterative Development..
It breaks work into small managable tasks for sprints and emplies self organizing team approach
Key features includes
	Daily standup meeting
	product backlogs
	Delevering Incremental value to Customers
Scrum has to adapt changing requirements and delever high quality products more effficiently

Imagine a time in the late 90's in a Software Development firm.. they used to follow Waterfall methodology
	adapting to the changes is difficult with this currenlty
	responding to the changes quickly in this competitive world with less resposive time
	
The watefall model involves teams followed a series of steps, and only going forward after the provious steps are completed
this is best to use in the scenarios where the teams are small, and the project is expected to move in a predictable manner

Waterfall Model
	requirements gathering
	system design 
	implemetation
	testing
	delever/deployement
	maintenance
	
Disadvantages
	makes changes difficult
	it doesn't focus on the end-user/client
	testing phase is delayed untill the most of the project is completed
	measuring the proggress with in stages is difficult
	
to overcome these disadvantages...we have Agile........

what is Agile?
	in 2001 agile was introduced
	Agile is a set of principles used in project management and software development
	
	it enables the team to deliver value to their customers with ease
	Agile team deliver work in small but usable increments
	Evaluation of the requirements,plans and results take place continously. this allows teams to respond to the chanegs quickly
	
	
Some values mentioned in the manifesto
		Individuals and interactions		over 	processes and tools
		Customer Collaborations		over 		Contract Negotiation
		Working products 			over 		comprehensive Documentation
		
		Responding to the chage over Following a plan
		
		
Agile Principles
=============
	-> Customer satisfaction
	-> Welcome change
		changes needs to address, even late in the development process
	-> develiver frequently
	-> Work together
	-> movtivated team
	-> face to face interaction is the most efficient in the means of communication
	-> Working Software
	-> Constant phase => the agile process promotes sustainable development..
	-> Good Design
	-> Simplicity
	-> self organization
	-> Reflect and Adjust
	
Advatanges of Agile
=========
	Large amount of interactions between the client and the project team	
	Improved Transparency to clients in the every phase of the project
	The delivery of the output is predictable and can sometimes be earlier than expected
	The cost of the project are predictable and follow a rigid schedule
	The client can provide the priority of he features, allowign the team to ensure maximum project value
	By focusing on the needs of the users, the team can deliver value to the customers
	The project is broken into smaller units, with high quality development, testign and collaboration
	
Agile Methodologies
==========	
-> Extream programming 
-> Kanban	-> is a method used to design manage and improve the flow of the systems
			->Organizations can limit their flow of work and limiting their work in progress
-> Lean 
	is a set of tools and principles that aims to identify and remove waste to increase the speed of the process development.
	It focuses on maximizing the value of the client, ensuring waste is minimized

-> Scrum	
		Scrum is a framework that is used by the teams to establish a hypothesis, try it out, reflect the experience and adjust
		It is used to enables the teams to incorporate practices and the other frameowrks depending on the teams requirements
	it is used when the cross funtional teams are working  on the product development when the work is split into more than one 2-4 weeks iterations 
-> Crystal
	it is an approach to s/w development and focuses on peopel and their intractions, rather than tools and processes


Agile vs scrum
==================
==> Agile is a set of principles that's iterative and incremental in nature
=> Suited for projects involving a small team of experts
=> Project head takes care of the all tasks an vital to the project
=> The methodology requires frequent delivery to the end user
=> face to face interactions take place between cross-functional teams
=> The design and execution is simple

=> Scrum is an implemetation of agile methodology 
=> Used in projects where the requirements a re constantly changing
=> There is no leader, the scrum master and the team addresses the issues..it inloves the cross functional, self-organizing team
=> With sprints, builds are delivered to clients feedback
=> daily standup meetings help with collaboration
=> The design and execution can be innovative and experimental


Kanban?
==============
Kanban.. which translates to signboard is a visual system that is used for managing work as it goes through the process
Kanban helps determine bottlenecks, and then fix them in a cost-effective manner and optimal speeds. this is done with the help of a kanban board..
it invovles having work beeing split into pieces, and the work is item is written on a note/card and put on board
the colums help illuestrate where each item is in the workflow

working?
	to-do
	On-going
	Done
	
	
Lean and agile
============
Reduces work in progress
The work is broken into pieces
both use pull scheduling
Transparency drives process improvements
the release plan is continously optimizes
relaeses deliverables are delivered offen and early



Scrum vs Kanban
===============
scrum		-> the process is devided into time-constrainted iterations
		-> releases takes place at the end of the each sprint
		-> chanegs can't made during the sprint
		=> Velocity is the default metric used in planning the process improvement
		=> cross -funtional teams are mandatory for requirements
		=> Items can't be added in between the an iteration
		=>Has 3 major jo roles
			product owner
			scrum master
			Scrum team
		=> scrum board needs to be reset afer each sprint
		=> it is better suited fror long runing projects
kanban  -> event-driven instead of timeboxed
		-> Releases takes place int he form of continous delivery
		-> Changes can made at any time
		-> Lead time is the default metric used for planning  and process improvement
		-> Specialist teams are required and cross functional teams are optional
		-> new capacity can be added, if there's capacity available
		-> Specific job roles havent; been setup
		-> Kanban board stays persistance through-out the project
		-> Kanban works better for projects thet are expected to finish in shorter time
		
		
==============
User Stories,Epics describes anything of value that the team can produce for the customers


User stories are agile s/w development project management tool that provides users with simple, natural language explanations of one or more features
written from the end-users perspective

User story doen't go in details.. it jsut mentioned how certain type of work will bring value tot he end user
User storeis also forms the building blcoks of agaile frameowrks like epics and intiatives

epics represents large amount of work broken down into user stories

combination of multiple epics forms a intiative

these helps us to ensure the the teams work tot he goals of  the organizatin through the epics and initiatives


Adv of User Stories
===
Delivers high quality content
Eases collaboration with team members
Helps understanding users better
Improves tranparency
Reduces risks
supports iterative development.



INVEST is a concept that helps create a meaningful user stories
Independent->
Negotiable--> Stories should be discussable and should be open for negotiation
Valuble -> storeis must be balue ensure to the customers always
Estimable => storeis must be esimable and  can be devided into tasks
Small =>stories shouldn't be too big 
Testable

Agile Project Management
=============
APM is a way by which project can be managed by breaking it into several stages of sprints
it doeent' require a project manager to have a central control

Agile Development Cyc;
==
product backlog ->at the end of each stage we get a mini project, there's a product backlog that explains new feautres and changes in the existing features
				in several other requirements in the project
Spring backlog -> which has a list of tasks that are to be completed during each sprint
				every sprint consists of 
					planning
					designing
					Execution
					Testing 
					Release
 
 why APM?
 ======
 High products quality
 high customer satisfaction
 Reduce Risks
 Better and faster ROI
 
 principles of APM
 ===============
 -> customer is satisfied bcs of fast and continous delevarables
 -> Shortening the period between planning and delivery, increases the effectiveness of the work
 -> Managers and Developers work together for better understanding and productive work
 -> Accepting stackholder changes even late in the development phase 
 -> Better coordination with team members
 -> Monotering the project progress at each iteration and finding solutions wherever needed
 -> trust and supports the team to complete project objectives
 -> The requirements are understood, and the simplest solution to meet those requirements is taken
 
 
 6 steps in APM
 ========
 -> Project Planning
 -> roadmap creation
 -> Release planning
 -> sprint Planning
 -> Daily meetings
 -> sprint review and retrospective
 
 Most popular Agile frameworks are
 ======
 Kanban framework
 scrum framework
 Hybrid framework
 Lean framework
